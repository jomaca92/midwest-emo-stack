Not a fan of bits of the stack? Fork it, change it, and use `npx create-remix --template your/repo`! Make it your own.

## Development

- First run this stack's `remix.init` script and commit the changes it makes to your project.

  ```sh
  npx remix init
  git init # if you haven't already
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initialize project"
  ```

- Initial setup:

  ```sh
  npm run setup
  ```

- Start dev server:

  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

The database seed script creates a new user with some data you can use to get started:

- Email: `rachel@remix.run`
- Password: `racheliscool`

### Relevant code:

This is a pretty simple note-taking app, but it's a good example of how you can build a full stack app with Prisma and Remix. The main functionality is creating users, logging in and out, and creating and deleting notes.

- creating users, and logging in and out [./app/models/user.server.ts](./app/models/user.server.ts)
- user sessions, and verifying them [./app/session.server.ts](./app/session.server.ts)
- creating, and deleting notes [./app/models/note.server.ts](./app/models/note.server.ts)

## Deployment with Coolify

This Remix Stack has been modified to work with [Coolify](https://coolify.io/), a self-hosted Heroku/Netlify alternative that you can run on your own VM.

### Setting up Coolify

1. Install Coolify on your VM by following the [official documentation](https://coolify.io/docs/installation/requirements).

2. Once Coolify is set up, create a new project and connect it to your GitHub repository.

3. Configure the deployment settings:
   - Select "Docker" as the deployment method
   - Set the port to 3000
   - Add the following environment variables:
     - `SESSION_SECRET`: Generate a random string using `openssl rand -hex 32` or a password generator
     - `DATABASE_URL`: `file:/data/sqlite.db`

4. Set up persistent storage:
   - Add a volume mapping from `/data` in the container to a persistent storage location on your VM

5. Configure the build settings:
   - Coolify will automatically detect the Dockerfile in your repository
   - No additional build commands are needed

### Automatic Deployments

Coolify will automatically detect changes to your repository and trigger a new build and deployment when you push to your main branch. The GitHub Actions workflow in this repository will run tests before your code is deployed.

### Connecting to your database

The SQLite database is stored in a persistent volume on your VM. You can connect to it through Coolify's terminal feature or by SSH'ing into your VM and accessing the container.

## Testing

### Cypress

We use Cypress for our End-to-End tests in this project. You'll find those in the `cypress` directory. As you make changes, add to an existing file or create a new file in the `cypress/e2e` directory to test your changes.

We use [`@testing-library/cypress`](https://testing-library.com/cypress) for selecting elements on the page semantically.

To run these tests in development, run `npm run test:e2e:dev` which will start the dev server for the app as well as the Cypress client. Make sure the database is running in docker as described above.

We have a utility for testing authenticated features without having to go through the login flow:

```ts
cy.login();
// you are now logged in as a new user
```

We also have a utility to auto-delete the user at the end of your test. Just make sure to add this in each test file:

```ts
afterEach(() => {
  cy.cleanupUser();
});
```

That way, we can keep your local db clean and keep your tests isolated from one another.

### Vitest

For lower level tests of utilities and individual components, we use `vitest`. We have DOM-specific assertion helpers via [`@testing-library/jest-dom`](https://testing-library.com/jest-dom).

### Type Checking

This project uses TypeScript. It's recommended to get TypeScript set up for your editor to get a really great in-editor experience with type checking and auto-complete. To run type checking across the whole project, run `npm run typecheck`.

### Linting

This project uses ESLint for linting. That is configured in `.eslintrc.cjs`.

### Formatting

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for auto-formatting in this project. It's recommended to install an editor plugin (like the [VSCode Prettier plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)) to get auto-formatting on save. There's also a `npm run format` script you can run to format all files in the project.
